Pressure from the steam continues to build until the hull ruptures, allowing the kernel to forcefully expand, to 20 to 50 times its original size, and then cool.[1]\n\nSome strains of corn (taxonomized as Zea mays) are cultivated specifically as popping corns. The Zea mays variety everta, a special kind of flint corn, is the most common of these.\n\nPopcorn is one of six major types of corn, which includes dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, flour corn, and sweet corn.[2]",
